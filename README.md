# SMS-Spam-Detection-Using-NLP-and-ML
     Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.     In this project, we will try to build a simple classifier using machine learning which will help in identifying whether a given SMS is a spam or not.
